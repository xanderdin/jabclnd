* How to setup Openfire to get users from custom DB.

1. Install Openfire server.
2. Connect to web-console and finish the setup procedure.
3. Login to web-console as admin user.
4. Go to Server Manager -> System Properties.
5. Delete provider.auth.className and provider.user.className properties.
6. Stop Openfire server.
7. Edit the provided openfire.xml file and replace with it the one in
   Openfire conf directory.
8. As the openfire.xml file contains database access credentials, change
   file permissions accordingly:

   chown openfire.openfire conf/openfire.xml
   chmod 640 conf/openfire.xml

9. Add admin user and all required users to openfire_users table in custom DB.
10. Start Openfire server, login as admin user to its web-console, check
   added users. If all is Ok, proceed with other required configuration.

Note: if something goes wrong,  it's easier to uninstall Openfire server
completely and start the whole procedure from the beginning.
